	<description>after having my first Spaceship launch in the tropical rainforest biome, I have noticed it actually didn’t feel as tropical as I would like it to feel. There were Monkeys, Tortoises, and an Elephant here and there; it doesn’t really give away that unique, diverse environment vibe. Sarg and Oskar have decided to expand on it with a range of new, unique animals, which include multiple types of automobiles.
	
	Cars are possibly the most “jungle” animals there are. It is absolutely possible to tame your own army of pickup trucks and send them off to hunt down the enemies, just as it is possible to have a peaceful car farm on the outskirts of the jungle!
	
	Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Vehicles expansion. It adds new animals that will spawn most Biomes. They have art work, sounds, and balancing done in the style of the Vanilla rendition of "Rimworld".</description>
